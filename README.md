# Graph Generator

A very basic CLI to generate CSV's of undirected graphs.
For use in Genetic Algorithms project, particularly evaluating genetic algorithm performance on k-colorable graph problems.

Maybe i'll add undirected graphs and weighted edges when school winds down for the semester.

## Usage

`python graph_generator.py NUMBER_OF_NODES TARGET_FILE_NAME`

in other words

`python graph_generator.py 10 targetFile.csv` will yeild

![sample output from command line](sample_output.csv)

and a csv file with your designated name will be generated inside the working directory.
